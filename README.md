# QuickTeams-modified
 
This is based on a project by https://github.com/tamhinsf/QuickTeams

Main updates to above in this modified repo:
1. Since tamhinsf wrote the project there were considerable changes to the MS Graph Explorer endpoints. I have updated those.
2. Downloading now uses names of the channels as folder names rather than channel_IDs. 

Working on:
1. Updates to realtime capabilities. 
2. Filtering (real-time or fixed frequency) posts for content (ex: offensive language).
